# Custom Discord Bot 🤖

A functional Discord bot built with Python using the `discord.py` library.

> **🚧 Status:** Functional MVP. Designed to explore the Discord API and practice OOP.

## 🎯 Purpose
I created this project to learn practice OOP programming in Python (`async`/`await`) and to understand how to interact with the Discord API. It handles events and responds to user commands.

## ⚡ Features
* **Custom Commands:** Responds to specific prefixes and keywords.
* **Event Handling:** Reacts to server events (e.g., ready status, message events).
* **Bot Interaction:** Demonstrates basic bot-to-user interaction logic.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install discord.py python-dotenv
